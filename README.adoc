This repository contains the Dockerfile definition for an ManageIQ installation
that is published through HTTP. This assumes you will change the ingress object

cluster level.

It also link:manageiq-node-port.yml[contains a file] that allows deploying it
on a `NodePort`, on 30443, thus without ingress, and a custom docker image.
